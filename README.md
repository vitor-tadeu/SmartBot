I developed an application that communicates with the Ford API to receive data from the driver's vehicle, I used this data to make a comparison with the current location and the possible places around it, if selected the path is sent to Google Maps.

### Objective:
```
1. Improve driver concentration and experience when driving your vehicle, reducing driver distraction at the wheel.
2. Bring relevant information to everyday life.
```

### Programming language:
 - Java

### Database:
 - SQLite
 
### APIs:
 - [Gloogle Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/overview) - Used to return place information.
 - [Gloogle Distance Matrix API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/start) - Used to return the distance and time from your location to the desired one.
 - [Ford - SmartDeviceLink](https://smartdevicelink.com/members/ford/) - Used to retrieve vehicle information.
 
 ### Final result:
